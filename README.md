# My Python Projects

Welcome to my collection of Python projects! This repository showcases my Python scripts and applications that I have built to improve my coding skills.

## Projects

### 1. **42repeated.py**
   - **Description**: This Python script counts how many times the number `42` appears in a list of 1000 unordered two-digit numbers.
   - **Technologies**: Written entirely from scratch in Python.
   - **Installation**:
     1. Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/AdamSabri91/My-Python-Projects.git
        ```
     2. Navigate to the project folder:
        ```bash
        cd My-Python-Projects
        ```
     3. Run the script:
        ```bash
        python 42repeated.py
        ```
   - **Usage**: Simply run the script in Python, and it will display how many times `42` appears in the list.
   
### 2. **repeated.py**
   - **Description**: This Python script allows the user to input a two-digit number and shows how many times that number is repeated in a list of 1000 unordered two-digit numbers.
   - **Technologies**: Written entirely from scratch in Python.
   - **Installation**:
     1. Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/AdamSabri91/My-Python-Projects.git
        ```
     2. Navigate to the project folder:
        ```bash
        cd My-Python-Projects
        ```
     3. Run the script:
        ```bash
        python repeated.py
        ```
   - **Usage**: After running the script, input any two-digit number, and it will return how many times the number is repeated in the list.

## Getting Started
To run these projects, you will need Python installed on your machine. You can use any Python IDE such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code with the Python extension.

## Future Projects
I plan to add new projects to this repository every 1â€“2 days to continue learning and improving my Python skills.
